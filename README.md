# airsensor

Fork of the airsensor software (https://code.google.com/p/usb-sensors-linux/source/browse/trunk/airsensor/airsensor.c) to read values from Velux Raumluftf√ºhler aka Voltcraft CO20 (probably going by other names also).

Some new command line arguments have been added to allow executing user commands on every new reading. Especially useful to send the data to some server (like FHEM or similar).
